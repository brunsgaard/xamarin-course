# Learn Xamarin for free at e-conomic

Interested in learning how to build cross-platform apps for iOS and Android using Xamarin?  Look no further. This fall e-conomic will host a weekly class, where you can come learn together with full time developers. We will create a space in e-conomic's development department where you will learn with help and feedback from our developers, in a nice environment in central Copenhagen.

## What will we be doing? 
* Watch some online videos
* Give a few lectures ourselves
* Independent projects with sparring and code reviews from e-conomic's mobile developers.

## Ok, so how much is it?
It's free. We have limited slots open, but the course is free of charge. While e-conomic will supply the location, coffee, and fresh fruit, you must bring your own hard- and software.

## So what is the catch?
There is no catch. We at e-conomic would like to create a resourceful environment, get in contact with new and future developers, and show you that we have a nice work place. We will not dictate what kind of app you can and cannot build. The aim of this course is for you to learn! No strings attached.

## Can I get ECTS points for this course?
Yes, our students have done this in the past. You just need to find a supervisor at your university who is willing to aprove it. We will not involve yourselves in this matter, but we will try to design the course in a way that the work load matches a 5 ECTS course.

## Practicalities
Direct any questions to our mobile developer Anders at ahk@e-conomic.com.  

* When: Thursdays from 12 o'clock.
* First day 1st of September 2016. 
* Last day December 1st 2016.   
* No class on the 6th of October.

## Prerequisites
This course will not cover the basics of programming and computer science. Before attending this course you must have some programming experience. In particular we require that you have already gotten your feet wet with C#. With the right background, following a preliminary online course in C# could be sufficient.

Furthermore, as you will be working together with other students, you must have some basic knowledge of working with revision control software. At e-conomic we use Git, and we strongly urge you to do so too. While we will gladly help you, there will be no lessons on Git.
