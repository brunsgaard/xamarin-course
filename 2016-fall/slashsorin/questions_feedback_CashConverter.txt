Hi,

I thought about having this file for questions/feedback. Please let me know if it makes sense or not.


Hereâ€™s what I come up with:

1. I pushed my solution for displaying the alerts on iOS and Android, as it was the course homework. 

But, I could only test it on iOS, the Android Emulator seems not to be working anymore.
PS. this time is have 100GB free on my computer, so no lack of space issues this time:)

2. You also mentioned that the Exception handling could be done better. Should I try implement a custom exception class in C#, or what would be your suggestion for it?
